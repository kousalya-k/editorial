                Perhaps the most abiding image of the recent saga of the Chandrayaan-2 mission,
                which came tantalisingly close to getting the Vikram spacecraft to make a soft landing on the
                lunar surface, was that of the Prime Minister embracing and consoling the
                chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). That single act said
                eloquently what words could not have expressed adequately: that though the mission could not
                achieve one of its prime objectives,
                it had notched up a series of outstanding successes along the way for which the entire nation is proud.

                the band of dedicated scientists and engineers of the space agency, who had given their
                all for the success of the mission. Watching the sequence of events, as a former

                professional, I could not help but reflect on the sharp contrast of the Chandrayaan-2 with
                another initiative, this one by the Indian Railways, which succeeded in achieving its objectives
                on schedule and yet, within a few months, unravelled in an unexpectedly different manner.
